## Daily Progress

I will be updating this repository daily with my progress, including code snippets, projects, and solutions to the challenges I tackle. Follow along and feel free to provide your feedback and suggestions.

## Day 1: Variables & Data Types

On the first day, I learned about variables and data types in JavaScript. Understanding how to declare and use variables, as well as the different types of data (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.), is fundamental to writing effective JavaScript code.

### Key Concepts Covered:

- Variable declaration using `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Primitive data types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`
- Non-primitive data types: `object` (including arrays and functions)

## Day 2: Operators

On the second day of the 30-Day JavaScript Challenge, I focused on understanding and using various operators in JavaScript. These operators are crucial for performing calculations, making comparisons, and controlling the flow of logic in programs.

### Key Concepts Covered

- **Arithmetic and Assignment Operators** - Perform basic calculations and modify variable values.
- **Comparison and Logical Operators** - Compare values and combine conditions.
- **Ternary Operator** - Use for concise conditional expressions.

## Day 3: Control Structures / Flow

On the third day of the 30-Day JavaScript Challenge, Today's focus was on control structures and flow, which are essential for directing the execution of code based on various conditions and loops.

### Key Concepts Covered

â€¢ Implement and understand basic if-else control flow.
<br>
â€¢ Use nested if-else statements to handle multiple conditions.
<br>
â€¢ Utilize switch cases for control flow based on specific values.
<br>
â€¢ Apply the ternary operator for concise condition checking.
<br>
â€¢ Combine multiple conditions to solve more complex problems.
<br>

## Day 4: Loops

On the fourth day of the 30-Day JavaScript Challenge, Today's focus was on mastering loops in JavaScript, which are essential for repeating tasks and iterating over data.

### Key Concepts Covered

â€¢ Understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
<br>
â€¢ Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condition.
<br>
â€¢ Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
<br>
â€¢ Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
<br>
â€¢ Use loop control statements (break and continue) to control the flow of loops.
<br>

## Day 5: Functions

On the fifth day of the 30-Day JavaScript Challenge, Today's focus was on mastering functions in JavaScript, which are essential for structuring code, reusability, and solving complex problems efficiently.

### Key Concepts Covered

â€¢ Understand and define functions using function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
<br>
â€¢ Use function parameters and default values effectively.
<br>
â€¢ Create and utilize higher-order functions.
<br>
â€¢ Apply functions to solve common problems and perform calculations.
<br>
â€¢ Enhance code reusability and organization using functions.
<br>

## Day 8: ES6+ Features

On Day 8 of the 30-day JavaScript challenge from Chai aur Code, we dive into modern ES6+ features that significantly enhance JavaScript programming. This session covers template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators, default parameters, and enhanced object literals.

### Key Concepts Covered

1. **Template Literals**
   - **String Interpolation:** Embed expressions inside string literals using `${}`.
   - **Multi-line Strings:** Create strings that span multiple lines without needing escape characters.

2. **Destructuring**
   - **Array Destructuring:** Extract values from arrays into distinct variables.
   - **Object Destructuring:** Extract properties from objects and assign them to variables.

3. **Spread and Rest Operators**
   - **Spread Operator (`...`):** Expand arrays or objects into individual elements.
   - **Rest Parameter (`...`):** Collect multiple arguments into a single array in function definitions.

4. **Default Parameters**
   - Define default values for function parameters to handle cases where arguments are not provided.

5. **Enhanced Object Literals**
   - **Method Definitions:** Simplify function definitions within object literals.
   - **Computed Property Names:** Use expressions as property names in object literals.

## Day 9: DOM Manipulation

On Day 9 of the 30-day JavaScript challenge, we explore modern techniques for manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. This session covers selecting and altering DOM elements, creating and appending new elements, removing elements, modifying attributes and classes, and adding event listeners to create interactive web pages.

### Key Concepts
- **Selecting DOM Elements:** Using methods like `getElementById`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll` to access HTML elements.
- **Manipulating DOM Elements:** Changing the content, style, and attributes of elements.
- **Creating and Appending Elements:** Dynamically adding new elements to the DOM.
