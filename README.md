## Daily Progress
I will be updating this repository daily with my progress, including code snippets, projects, and solutions to the challenges I tackle. Follow along and feel free to provide your feedback and suggestions.

## Day 1: Variables & Data Types
On the first day, I learned about variables and data types in JavaScript. Understanding how to declare and use variables, as well as the different types of data (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.), is fundamental to writing effective JavaScript code.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Variable declaration using `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Primitive data types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`
- Non-primitive data types: `object` (including arrays and functions)
